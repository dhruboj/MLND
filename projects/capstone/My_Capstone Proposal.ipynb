    "For this capstone project, I will use a English Premier League Football dataset from http://football-data.co.uk/englandm.php . This is a binary classification problem similar to the `CharityML` in Supervised Learning section of the MLND. The legal sports-betting market in the U.S. was worth an estimated USD270 million in 2017 -- with another USD2.5 billion to USD3 billion in black market betting, according to research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, LLC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it is not legalized in many other countries like India, but for my own interest, I want to build a predictive model capable of predicting if the home team will win a football match. Usually betting is conducted with human instincts but now we can use some machine learning algorithm to predict the result of the future matches also.\n",
